/**
 * qa__fact_usage_metric_check.sql
 * -------------------------------
 * Recompute billing and margin metrics from base columns in FACT_USAGE
 * and compare them to the stored metric values.
 *
 * Metric definitions:
 * - billed_value   = units_used * unit_price
 *   Total cost of all usage before applying any allowance
 *
 * - included_value = included_units * unit_price
 *   Shows what portion of usage was covered by the plan.
 *
 * - margin_value   = (units_used â€“ included_units) * unit_price
 *   Overage value beyond the allowance.
 *
 * - margin_pct     = margin_value / billed_value
 *   How much of the total bill comes from overages.
 *
 * Input:
 * - None (runs across all rows in FACT_USAGE).
 *
 * Output:
 * - Side-by-side comparison of calculated vs stored metrics.
