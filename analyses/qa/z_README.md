# QA Analyses

This folder contains audit probes and diagnostic SQL that validate Ledgerlineâ€™s pipeline from staging through marts.

---

## Scope

- Check **referential integrity** - Do facts map to valid dimensions, and are default keys hit unexpectedly?  
- Validate **fact grain** - Confirm `fact_usage` respects `(customer_key, product_key, plan_key, report_date)`.  
- Test **continuity** - Ensure synthetic closes are generated when subscriptions disappear.  
- Recompute **metrics** - Verify billed amounts, included values, and margins against base inputs.  
- Track **row flow** - Confirm counts remain consistent across staging, history, refined, and marts.

- Default-key hit tracking (`qa__default_hits_by_day.sql`)  
- Synthetic close timelines (`qa__synthetic_close_timelines.sql`)  
- Metric recomputation (`qa__fact_usage_metric_check.sql`)
